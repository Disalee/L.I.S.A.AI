# L.I.S.A.
This is my voice assistant made with MyCroft for the Raspberry Pi called L.I.S.A.

L.I.S.A. means Laughingly Intelligent Self Assistant. The inspiration for the name came from Lalisa Manoban aka Lisa of the korean girlgroup BLACKPINK. Why? Because she's a awesome dancer and singer and her name is perfekt for a wakeword.

This is where the logo color and font come from too.

Yes, I will continue to use pictures of Lisa and other BLACKPINK girls.
